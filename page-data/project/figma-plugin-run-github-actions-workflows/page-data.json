You just need to setup a new workflow clicking on the `+` button. You'll need a GitHub [Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to run workflows.\n\nAfter that, you can select a `page` and one or more `nodes` from that page and click on `â–¶`. This will run the selected workflow, passing your selection as workflow' inputs.\n\n### GitHub\n\nBefore running a workflow for the first time, you'll need to properly setup a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) :smiley:.\n\nThe GitHub Actions workflow needs to have a set of inputs (the same that the plugin will send):\n\n```yaml\non: \n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      fileKey:\n        description: Figma file key\n        type: string\n        required: true\n      page:\n        description: Stringified selected page (id, name)\n        type: string\n        default: '{}'\n        required: true\n      selection:\n        description: Stringified array of the selected nodes (id, name)\n        type: string\n        default: '[]'\n        required: true\n```\n\nAside from this, you'll just need to configure the workflow as you prefer.\n\nCheckout a working example [`from-figma.yaml`](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/figma-plugin-run-github-actions-workflows/blob/main/github/workflows/from-figma.yaml).\n\nAs you can see inside the above example, you can also transform/manipulate the received inputs in order to shape them as you want.\n\n\n## Figma Export PDFs\n\nWhat do you think about *exporting Figma content as PDF to an FTP Server, just clicking a button from Figma*? Would it be cool, isn't it?\n\nTake a look at this [workflow](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/figma-export-pdfs-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/from-figma.yaml) and find out how this is totally feasible. Just clone the workflow and setup this Figma plugin :wink:\n"}},
