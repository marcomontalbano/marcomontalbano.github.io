The game was developed in [Microsoft Visual C#](http://www.visualstudio.com/) 2005 using the [Microsoft XNA](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) library.\n\n[![NumbeRun Trailer - Marco Montalbano](https://ik.imagekit.io/marcomontalbano/tr:oi-youtube_play_2CggQdiSx.png/numberun_pl78r84gu.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdzL2DX0yU \"NumbeRun Trailer - Marco Montalbano\")\n\n\nPlay Now\n--------\n\n[Download NumbeRun](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/numberun/releases/latest) and play now on Windows 10.\n\nBefore play, you need to install DirectX and XNA from `setup` folder.\n\n_system requirements:_\n\n- [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/it-it/download/details.aspx?id=1639)\n- Microsoft XNA 1.0\n- Windows XP / 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10\n\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n![NumbeRun v2 - menu](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/numberun/raw/master/docs/assets/numberun_2__menu.jpg) ![NumbeRun v2 - guide](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/numberun/raw/master/docs/assets/numberun_2__guide.jpg) ![NumbeRun v2 - game1](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/numberun/raw/master/docs/assets/numberun_2__game1.jpg) ![NumbeRun v2 - game2](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/numberun/raw/master/docs/assets/numberun_2__game2.jpg)\n\n\nPlot\n----\n\nFiveRun has been trapped in the kingdom of DarkRun, an evil wizard who will do anything to prevent his escape.\n\nYou are the only one who can help FiveRun in his mission: leave DarkRun's lands stealing as much gold as he can. Mind though: these grounds are full of dangers! Pay attention to the GrumRuns (in the next release they will be renamed GrimRuns, 'cause I made a mistake), wicked creatures serving Lord DarkRun: they will haunt you and won't find their peace until they catch you.\n\nIn order to move from land to land, you need to find a magic door that you will be able to cross unscathed only if - that's for you to find out! :wink:\n\nNow you are ready to follow FiveRun in this adventure.\n\nOne last friendly piece of advice: FiveRun can't swim!\n\n\nOther versions\n--------------\n\nNumbeRun has been written in different programming languages during the years. The first version was in Pascal, then the game was re-written in C, then C++, then C++ with OpenGL and in the end in C# with Microsoft XNA.\n\nThe first release of the complete game was in C++ using a Windows Console, a big bidimensional matrix and **numbers as characters**, that's why the name is **NumbeRun** (numbers that run).\n\nIt was my very first project, the very first idea I worked on, just after starting high school. Every time I discovered a new language I took the chance to re-write it, so as to master the new knowledge. That's why there are so many versions of the same game. It evolved along with my competence.\n\n![NumbeRun v1 - menu](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/numberun/raw/master/docs/assets/numberun_1__menu.jpg) ![NumbeRun v1 - game 1](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/numberun/raw/master/docs/assets/numberun_1__game1.jpg) ![NumbeRun v1 - game 2](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/numberun/raw/master/docs/assets/numberun_1__game2.jpg) ![NumbeRun v1 - game over](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/numberun/raw/master/docs/assets/numberun_1__gameover.jpg)\n\n\nOpen Source\n-----------\n\nOn GitHub you can find all versions.
