The url is something similar to `cloudinary://my_key:my_secret@my_cloud_name`.\n\nNow you can easily deploy your own copy on Netlify.\n\n[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/marcomontalbano/video-to-markdown)\n\n\n## Development stuff\n\nTo run the project locally, here’s what you’ll need:\n\n### Requirements\n\n* [Cloudinary] account\n* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 10 or greater\n\n### Setup\n\n`cd` into your local copy of the repository and run `npm install`\n\n```\ncd video-to-markdown\nnpm install\n```\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will start the client server on http://localhost:8080, and the netlify-lambda server on http://localhost:8081.\n\n[netlify-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda) isn’t required to deploy Lambda functions to Netlify, but it offers some handy features out of the box that make it quicker to get started, like the local dev server and nice defaults for transpiling and bundling functions in production.\n\nThe client server is configured to proxy `/.netlify` requests to the Lambda server (see [webpack.client.js](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/video-to-markdown/blob/master/webpack.client.js)). This is the same behavior the site has when it’s deployed to Netlify.\n\n## Privacy\n\nGoogle Analytics is used to record the following:\n\n* [Basic visit data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?ref_topic=2919631).\n* `referer` or `video url` to track api usage.\n\nAll images are generated via [Cloudinary] and stored in it.\nIn this way the generated images are cached so we can avoid to call Netlify functions again thus reducing the quota consumption.\n\nBy clicking on `convert to markdown` or consuming api you accept this terms & condition; no additional data is sent to the server.\n\n[Cloudinary]: https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/nfvt85kdqleszdah0hxq\n"}}}
