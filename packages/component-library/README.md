# Component Library

This project is a [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) collection of React components that I'm using to build my website.

All components are available as [npm package](https://github.com/marcomontalbano/marcomontalbano.github.io/packages/79405) using [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages).

The storybook site is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and available at http://component-library.marcomontalbano.com. The build is triggered by a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) every time a new package version is published.
