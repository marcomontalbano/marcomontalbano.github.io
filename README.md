# My personal website

Back in 2019, I built the initial release of this website. It was intentionally over-engineered because, at that time, I aimed to enhance my knowledge of TypeScript, React, Storybook, Gatsby, Styled Components, GitHub Actions, and GitHub Packages.

As of today (2024), I have mastered all of them (I removed Gatsby from my bag), which is why I have chosen to rebuild this website from scratch using an entirely different stack.

This new website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). They are absolutely fantastic!
